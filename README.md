# WordPress MimbleWimble Coin Donation Button

### Description
Plugin for WordPress that adds a MimbleWimble Coin donation button to WordPress's block editor blocks that's capable of accepting MimbleWimble Coin donations without having to run any wallet software.

### Installing
Download this plugin's [newest release](https://github.com/NicolasFlamel1/WordPress-MimbleWimble-Coin-Donation-Button/releases) and choose to upload it as a plugin on your WordPress site's add plugins page. After it's been installed and activated, you can add a MimbleWimble Coin donation button to any page in WordPress's block editor.

This plugin relies on PHP's foreign function interface to load shared libraries at runtime, so make sure the `ffi.enable` setting in your `php.ini` or `httpd.conf` file is set to `true`.
